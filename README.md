##Project Question
John Paul and Matthew are two student entrepreneurs who just won a $20,000 fund to create their software app startup company. John Paul is a business major and Matthew is an accounting major, and both have no experience in technology or software development. They approached you with an offer of 33% equity as the Chief Technology Officer in their startup company with the requirement that you turn their idea into reality. You accepted the offer and signed the NDA to begin negotiations.
 
They explain that they want to develop a unique artist audio and video content search application.
 
 
- [x]        The application should have an input field that can collect an artist's name.
- [x]        The application should use Apple’s Search API to look up all audio and video content of an artist. For example https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jack+johnson returns a json text file that contains information about Jack Johnson’s records (more info can be found on https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/#searching). The application should display the all information for this artist in a table or list by tracking information on the Main Page.
- [x]         The results shown per table cell should include Artist Name, Release Date, and Track Name.
- [x]        The list can support pagination in multiples of 10. However, this is not required in version 1 (bonus points).
- [x]        When a cell (track) is selected, the application shows a details page with more information, such as the Artist Name, Track Name, Release Date, Collection Name, Collection Price, Track Price, Track Number, Track Count, Image (bonus points), Kind and Primary Genre Name.
- [x]        Although not required in version 1 (bonus points), Matthew thinks the application should have a save feature that can download and save all the information displayed in the table (on the Main page) in a text file and this text file can be uploaded at any time without calling the Apple API.

*(Note: you do not have to do everything on the list; only complete what you can in the allotted time.)*

You accepted the offer and now have 72 hours to create the first prototype of this application. You also agreed to develop the application in only one of the following environments:
 
- [x]       **Web Application**: Using HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, ASP.net or any language that you are proficient in. Feel free to use any design libraries that you want such as bootstrap, bootbox, jquery, jquery.datatables, etc.
-        **Desktop Application**: Java, python, C#, Objective C, or any language you are proficient in.
-        **Console Application**: Using any language you are proficient in.
-        **Mobile Application**: Native Andoid, native iOS or hybrid apps.

Please feel free to use any libraries (under MIT license). Also include any installation and user instructions if required.
